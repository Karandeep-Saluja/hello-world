A Bachelor's student, keen on sharpening my technical skills in the area of Cloud Computing. 
Being an inquisitive person and a self motivated learner with the belief that “It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop” , I intend to apply my skills appropriately and perform to the best of my potential.
